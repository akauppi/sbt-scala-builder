# Changelog

## 16-Jan-19

- Trying without `build.sbt` and with no cross-compiling. *Hoping* this may cause `compiler-bridge` to be properly cached (but likely it's not...).

## 15-Jan-19

- Run as a user (not root)
- Clarifications why installing from source is better than using 'apt-get' (which is recommended by sbt)
- only supporting one Scala version (easy to change)

## 9-Dec-18

- Avoided getting Docker into the image (reduces size)

## 6-Dec-18

- Should be useful in projects. (not actually tested)
